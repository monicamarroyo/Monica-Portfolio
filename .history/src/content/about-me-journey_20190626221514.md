**The first program I ever wrote was Hello World application in a college classroom.** A course that I had no idea existed until after I declared a major. I didnâ€™t walk into college with a career or profession in mind, in all honesty everything I learned in highschool was to prepare myself for a career in Culinary. While in college I noticed I enjoyed my mathematics and problem solving. **So I thought it would be fun and challenging to major in the toughest engineering program my university had to offer.** Since graduating, I decided to teach myself how to build real world applications with the help of Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, documentation and articles. **Since then I strive and continue to learn web development in hopes of becoming a Full Stack Developer.**

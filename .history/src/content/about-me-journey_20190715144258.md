**The first program I ever wrote was Hello World application in a college classroom.** A course that I had no idea existed until after I declared a major. I never imagined myself in college yet alone with a profession in engineering. It was during college that I discovered my passion for mathematics and problem solving. **I love challenges, therefore I majored in the toughest engineering program my University had to offer, and thats how I descovered programming.** Since graduating, I decided to teach myself how to build real world applications with the help of Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, documentation and articles. **Since then I strive and continue to learn in hopes of becoming a Full Stack Developer.**
